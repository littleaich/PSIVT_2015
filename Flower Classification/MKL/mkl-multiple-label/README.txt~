This package contains the source code for multiple kernel learning with multiple labels. 

Please refer to the following paper for algorithm details:
@INPROCEEDINGS{Tang-etal09-IJCAI,
  author = {Lei Tang and Jianhui Chen and Jieping Ye},
  title = {On Multiple Kernel Learning with Multiple Labels},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial
	Intelligence},
  year = {2009},
}



Here are some descriptions of the code:
SILP_1norm_independent.m:  The INDEPENDENT Model, each label selects kernel independently;
SILP_1norm_partial.m: The PARTIAL model, allowing partial kernel sharing among different labels;
SILP_1norm_same.m: The SAME model, all labels selets the same kernel;

For convenient comprehension, we provide a toy example and a driver file to call different functions. 

In order to run the code, two packages must be installed and add to the matlab path:
1. libsvm matlab inferface(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). After compilation, the runnable "svmtrain" is required. 
2. mosek (http://www.mosek.com/). We use mosek to solve the LP problem involved. Mosek provides student trial license. Please refer to the corresponding documents for installation. 
Please do add the runnable path of both packages to the matlab path, otherwise the code provided here is not runnable.
